# flutter_demo

My first Flutter learning project. Tests Flutter reactive changes and good code practices in Dart.

## Getting Started

Based on the tutorial available at [Your first Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0). 

Some changed were made while following the tutorial, such as using functional programming (at favorite words screen) for learning its use in Dart. 

Feel free to clone and experiment with this project!
